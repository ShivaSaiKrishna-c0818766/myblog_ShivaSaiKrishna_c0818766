                 <h1>Life after Google</h1>
                 <img src="images/google.jpg" alt="Life after Google">
                 <p>There’s no avoiding the world of Google. In the 20 years since it was established, Google has redefined the way we interact online and with the world. It's even become a verb in the process. But is its tapestry of big data and free access truly a good thing? And will it be capable of holding its seat of power in the future? Because while Google retains information on almost everyone, it doesn’t have all that data under a proper lock and key. However, if Google’s heyday is approaching an end, what will replace it? That's where cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and bitcoin come in. This book summary describes the atmosphere that Google has created and why it’s no longer sustainable, also explaining how and why the cryptocosm’s focus on security is evolving and will continue to. In this summary of Life After Google by George Gilder, you'll also discover:
                    what a “Siren Server” is;
                    why you shouldn’t be concerned about Artificial Intelligence; and
                    who Satoshi Nakamoto is.</p>
